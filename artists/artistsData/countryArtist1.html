        <p>Roy Tucker is your classic country singer. That's what everyone would think when they see him standing up on stage
		with boots, a hat, and even a pickup truck. Why then would he move to San Diego? For the beer, of course! Roy
		also moved because his wife, Sally, joined the nursing program at Rady's Children's Hospital, but he doesn't
		mind the move that much. The weather is much nicer, he says. When he started feeling homesick he picked up his
		grandfather's guitar, one of the only possessions he brought with him, and strummed a tune. Neighbors were
		thoroughly impressed and said he should take his talent to the folks all around San Diego. Roy best prefers playing
		at small barbecues and family gatherings, but recently signed up with some large events! Be sure not to miss him!</p>
